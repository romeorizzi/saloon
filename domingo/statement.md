# Saloon ultimate: just one key!

## General setting of the sequel (this is the last episode):

You have a part-time job in a saloon.
The job is flexible and asks you to play the piano, clean the floor (which is where you actually get your reward), but also to mantain the records of the bills. This last is the most challenging part in that, it is often impossible the custumers to pay their bills in many situations (drunk too beer or whisky, holding a gun bigger than that of the sceriff, passed away in a shooting, lost everything at the card table, ...).
The frequent shootings do not scare you in that, as we said, you are also the one who plays the piano. They do affect your credits recording activity however in that, while initially you had the ten digits plus a comma key on your typewriter keyboard, it may happen some days that, because of a shooting, some keys are gone and you must organize yourself to cope with the one left in the meanwhile you wait for the repair team which only works at night when the saloon closes (you are also the part-time man of the repair team).

## In this episode:

Today is last day of the week, el sianto domingo. The shootings have left you with just one key. Can you still do your job?


### Goals 

Questo problema prevede un singolo goal: riuscire a fare comunque il proprio lavoro, ovviamente riscendo a ricostruire correttamente la sequenza.
Poichè in TuringArena abbiamo deciso di offrire solo il tipo intero a 32 bits per dare base uniforme a tutti i linguaggi di programmazione, la sequenza conterrà massimo 7 numeri, ed in quel caso davvero molto piccoli, ma già questo dovrebbe consentirvi di testare se le vostre idee possano funzionare.

- `correct`: sequenze corte e numeri sempre più contenuti.
- `correct-special-cases`: gestisci correttamente anche una sequenza vuota?
